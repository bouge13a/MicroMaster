# MicroMaster Mini Overview
* The MicroMaster Mini, like the Bus-Pirate, Shikra, and Hydrabus before it, is a small circuit board that communicates to a computer via a Virtual COM port.
* The purpose of the MicroMaster Mini is to allow the user to test commands that may be sent from a master to a slave device using a variety of protocols such as UART, CAN, I2C, SMBUS, SPI, 1-Wire, WS2812 (neopixel) and PWM. The MicroMaster Mini also allows the user to "sniff" CAN, SMBUS, and I2C transactions.
* Unlike the Bus-Pirate and Bus-Pirate derived devices, the MicroMaster Mini employs a highly sophisticated serial interface that has a system of pages similar to a web browser that can be navigated and manipulated with an ASCII keyboard. 
* Allows users to monitor the registers of I2C devices and SPI devices in real time. 
* Has an integrated help feature for each page which describes the purpose and operation of each page. The MicroMaster Mini does not require a manual for use. 
* Allows the user to easily manipulate 4 GPOs and monitor 4 GPIs and 4 ADCs. 
* Operates as an FTDI chip emulator so that the user can transmit UART signals to a USB virtual COM port. 
* Has a suite of neopixel control tools which allow the user to easily control up to 999 neopixels!
* Programmable power supply to 1v6 3v3 and 5v. The I2C bus also level shifts with the power supply. 
* The entire project is open sourced.
